# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

## Overview

The instructions in this readme will get a copy of the project up and running on a local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

It is assumed that an active connection to the internet will be available at all times. To run this program only Python and GIT are required. It was designed and tested on Python 2.7.10. Check if you have python installed.

MAC
Most Macs come with Python 2.7 already installed, but it’s good to double-check the version. To determine whether you have Python 2.7, open the Terminal application, type the following, and press Return:
```
python -V
```

This command will report the version of Python:
```
Python 2.7.3
```


WINDOWS 7
To get to the command line, open the Windows menu and type “command” in the search bar. Select Command Prompt from the search results.

In the Command Prompt window, type the following and press Enter.
```
python
```

If Python is installed and in your path, then this command will run python.exe and show you the version number.
```
Python 2.7.4 (r264:75708, Oct 10 2009, 07:36:50) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for further information.
```

Otherwise, you will see:
```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

In this case, you need to download and install Python 2.7.10 and then add it to your path. These instructions were taken from Google documentation and more examples on setting up testing for Python can be found here:
https://edu.google.com/openonline/course-builder/docs/1.10/set-up-course-builder/check-for-python.html

Python is available for download here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/


To test if you have GIT on Terminal (Linux, macOS) or Command prompt (Windows) use:
```
git --version 
```

Which if installed should produce an output similar to:
```
git version 2.3.2
```

If an supported version is seen or the command itself isn't recognised, then GIT will need to be installed. Please see the link below for furthe rinstructions on installing GIT:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git


### Installing

To install the application, assuming that the required prerequistite software is installed, use GIT to either clone the repo, or download it.

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
